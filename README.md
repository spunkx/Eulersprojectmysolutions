# Eulersprojectmysolutions
Solutions to problems on the Euler project problem set in C

Aiming to make non-recursive solutions and recursive solutions to show that I understand both.
If there's a problem that requires a complex object, I may do that in C++ for simplicity.
Will be making what I believe are the solutions and then reviewing later.

As I gain a deeper understanding of mathematics, I will endevour to create proofs for my C solutions. 
Perhaps I will create some different examples using different numbers to explore the concepts these problems introduce.
